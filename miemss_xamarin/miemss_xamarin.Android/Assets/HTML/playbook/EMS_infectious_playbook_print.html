<p><strong>EMS</strong> INFECTIOUS DISEASE <strong>PLAYBOOK</strong></p>
<p><strong>This document was created using official or best practice information</strong></p>
<p><strong>taken from multiple organizations that was vetted and assembled by</strong></p>
<p><strong>subject matter experts working for the Technical Resources, Assistance</strong></p>
<p><strong>Center, and Information Exchange (TRACIE) at the request of the</strong></p>
<p><strong>U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)/Office of the</strong></p>
<p><strong>Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR). The aim</strong></p>
<p><strong>was not to develop novel guidance for emergency medical services</strong></p>
<p><strong>(EMS) agencies, but to unify multiple sources of information in a single</strong></p>
<p><strong>planning document addressing the full spectrum of infectious agents to</strong></p>
<p><strong>create a concise reference resource for EMS agencies developing their</strong></p>
<p><strong>service policies. This document does not represent official policy of</strong></p>
<p><strong>HHS/ASPR or other federal or private agencies.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The information contained in this playbook is intended as a planning</strong></p>
<p><strong>resource, and should be incorporated into agency standard operating</strong></p>
<p><strong>procedures and reviewed by the EMS medical director. There is not</strong></p>
<p><strong>one correct way to don and doff personal protective equipment;</strong></p>
<p><strong>EMS agencies should review the guidelines and their specific</strong></p>
<p><strong>circumstances to develop procedures that are ensemble and site</strong></p>
<p><strong>appropriate. Appropriate education and training is critical to the</strong></p>
<p><strong>success of infection prevention and control protocols. The authors,</strong></p>
<p><strong>TRACIE, and HHS/ASPR take no responsibility and bear no liability for</strong></p>
<p><strong>any clinical care outcomes, provider injury/illness, or inaccuracies in or</strong></p>
<p><strong>resulting from this document. All recommendations were current at the</strong></p>
<p><strong>time of publication and vetted to the best of our ability.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Inclusion of specific references and resources is offered as an</strong></p>
<p><strong>acknowledgement of their contribution of material and for additional</strong></p>
<p><strong>information for EMS planners, but does not constitute endorsement or</strong></p>
<p><strong>vouch for accuracy or applicability of the referenced documents.</strong></p>

<p>GENERAL PRINCIPLES &#8211; CALL TAKING/DISPATCH</p>
<p>&#8226; Safe response by EMS requires an integrated approach: Appropriate information from</p>
<p>the caller and dispatcher; appropriate protocols for response, clinical care, application</p>
<p>of administrative and environmental controls and use of personal protective equipment</p>
<p>(PPE) by responding EMS personnel; and transport to a hospital that can provide effective</p>
<p>evaluation and treatment of the suspected condition.</p>
<p>&#8226; Ideally, 911 call takers/emergency medical dispatchers will identify possible infectious</p>
<p>disease patients through integrated routine screening questions and relay that information to</p>
<p>emergency responders prior to their arrival on the scene.</p>
<p>&#8226; During the caller interrogation, if information about communicable diseases is offered,</p>
<p>make sure the information is documented and relayed to responders in accordance with</p>
<p>established policies on how to share patient-related information.</p>
<p>&#8226; Screening for suspected highly infectious pathogens often involves questioning patients</p>
<p>about recent travel to endemic areas and presenting signs and symptoms. The timeframe</p>
<p>for these conditions varies (e.g., 14 days for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS),</p>
<p>21 for Ebola Virus Disease (EVD)); 21 days is used in the general screen for consistency</p>
<p>since this is inclusive of the diseases, but can be adjusted as required if screening for</p>
<p>specific pathogens.</p>
<p>&#8226; Local screening questions may be needed during outbreaks and can be inserted into the</p>
<p>dispatch algorithm and keyed to the appropriate precautions. EMS agencies should consult</p>
<p>with local and state public health and EMS authorities to identify required modifications to</p>
<p>processes and protocols to ensure consistency with CDC guidance.</p>
<p>&#8226; If persons under investigation for a highly infectious disease are known to public health,</p>
<p>it may be beneficial for public safety to enter a temporary note on their address in the</p>
<p>computer-aided dispatch system to alert 911 responders to the potential for illness/</p>
<p>exposure. This is a local decision dependent on the systems and policies in the community</p>
<p>and the note should be removed once the infectious period has passed.</p>
<p>&#8226; Fever may be a helpful contributing sign or symptom, but should not be used exclusively</p>
<p>to determine the presence or absence of disease as it is not universally present in cases of</p>
<p>serious communicable diseases.</p>
<p align="center"></p>
<p>GENERAL PRINCIPLES &#8211; RESPONSE</p>
<p>&#8226; Regardless of dispatch information, EMS personnel should be vigilant for travel history</p>
<p>and signs and symptoms of communicable disease (e.g., fever, cough, gastrointestinal</p>
<p>complaints) and use standard precautions and add appropriate transmission-based infection</p>
<p>control precautions whenever history or exam findings warrant.</p>
<p>&#8226; Implement strict standard and transmission-based precautions based on the patient's</p>
<p>clinical information to avoid exposure to potentially infectious bodily fluids, droplets, and</p>
<p>airborne particles.</p>
<p>&#8226; Avoid direct contact with a patient who may have a serious communicable disease until</p>
<p>you are wearing appropriate PPE.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>Maintaining a distance of at least six feet may provide</p>
<p>protection from transmission of many diseases.</p>
<p>&#8226; Understand and practice with PPE so that you can rapidly and safely don and carefully doff</p>
<p>the equipment without cross-contamination.</p>
<p>&#8226; Patients or their caregivers may find responders wearing high levels of PPE such as hood,</p>
<p>suits, and respirators alarming. Communicating with and calming anxious patients may be</p>
<p>more challenging due to PPE as well. Responders should be mindful of this and be prepared</p>
<p>to reassure patients and to address their distress and fear.</p>
<p>&#8226; Limit the number of EMS providers making contact with a potentially infectious patient to the</p>
<p>minimum required to perform tasks safely.</p>
<p>&#8226; EMS must be able to implement effective infection control practices to afford emergency</p>
<p>responder safety while avoiding excessive delays in care. Training and practice should allow</p>
<p>EMS personnel to provide emergent medical care without waiting for specialized response.</p>
<p>Specialized transport should be reserved for stable suspect serious communicable</p>
<p>disease patients (e.g., EVD, Marburg Disease, smallpox) or for inter-facility transport of those</p>
<p>with suspected or known disease. Many communities will also have dedicated infectious</p>
<p>disease medical transport services built into their regional transportation plan for planned</p>
<p>patient movements.</p>
<p>&#8226; Hand hygiene (e.g., handwashing with non-antimicrobial soap and water, alcohol-based</p>
<p>hand rub, or antiseptic handwash) is one of the best ways to remove germs, avoid getting</p>
<p>sick, and prevent the spread of germs to others.</p>
<p>&#8226; Placing a surgical mask on a patient with likely infectious cough significantly limits droplet</p>
<p>generation. Patients should cover their nose and mouth when coughing or sneezing; use</p>
<p>tissues to contain respiratory secretions and, after use, dispose them in the nearest waste</p>
<p>receptacle; and perform hand hygiene after having contact with respiratory secretions and</p>
<p>contaminated objects or materials.</p>
<p>&#8226; Influenza and other diseases can transmit via the ocular surfaces as well as other mucous</p>
<p>membranes. Use PPE to protect the mucous membranes of the eyes, nose, and mouth</p>
<p>during procedures and patient care activities that are likely to generate splashes or sprays</p>
<p>of blood, body fluids, secretions, and excretions. Select masks, goggles, face shields, and</p>
<p>combinations of each according to the need anticipated by the task performed.</p>
<p>&#8226; Infection control practices can evolve with novel agents or during infectious disease</p>
<p>outbreaks or epidemics. The EMS agency must be aware of changes that affect employees.</p>
<p>&#8226; EMS agencies should exercise their response to a highly infectious disease patient with</p>
<p>hospitals and other healthcare coalition partners.</p>
<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>1 The maximum distance for droplet transmission is unresolved. While the area of defined risk has historically</p>
<p>been a distance of less than 3 feet from the patient, experimental smallpox studies and SARS investigations</p>
<p>suggest droplets could be transmitted 6 feet or more. The recommendation to maintain a distance of 6 feet or</p>
<p>more is used throughout this document to be conservative given the uncertainty. Page 17 of https://www.cdc.</p>
<p>gov/hicpac/pdf/isolation/isolation2007.pdf provides additional details.</p>
<p align="center"></p>
<p>DISPATCH SCREENING ALGORITHM*</p>
<p>*Dispatch screening is designed to suggest the highest potential level of precautions that may be required.</p>
<p>On-scene evaluation is required to adjust precautions according to history and exam. Transmission based</p>
<p>precautions are always accompanied by standard precautions.</p>
<p><img src="dispatch_screening.png" width="541" height="617" class="resizable" metadata="obj2" border="0" alt="dispatch_screening.png"></p>
<p>NOTES ON THE ALGORITHM:</p>
<p>&#8226; Basic travel and symptom screening suggests a level of precautions for responders. On-scene,</p>
<p>additional evaluation is required to determine if higher or lower levels of protection are required.</p>
<p>&#8226; If a medically trained dispatcher is not available, these questions may still be used. If the</p>
<p>dispatch agency declines to ask these questions, a process should be in place to refer the</p>
<p>caller to an emergency medical dispatcher (EMD) if possible or the crew may be able to</p>
<p>establish contact with the patient/caller via a callback number. EMS systems should tailor</p>
<p>these functions and adopt processes appropriate for their structure and staffing.</p>
<p>&#8226; Responders should be aware of infectious disease outbreaks or epidemics in their</p>
<p>community and, based on a doorway evaluation, be prepared to rapidly adopt appropriate</p>
<p>infection control precautions in accordance with established public health guidelines.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ADDITIONAL DISPATCH CONSIDERATIONS</p>
<p>The following information may be used to update/modify dispatch reference cards:</p>
<p>&#8226; Call taker obtains location (and phone number) and patient status information (e.g., age,</p>
<p>consciousness, breathing normally).</p>
<p>&#187; Implement emergency medical dispatch to include giving the caller instructions to help</p>
<p>treat the patient until the responding EMS unit arrives per service protocols.</p>
<p>&#187; Consider modifying assignment to ambulance only for calls involving suspect EVD/VHF or</p>
<p>Special Respiratory Precautions patients based on travel or exposure history (i.e., cancel first</p>
<p>responder unless unconscious, difficulty breathing, or other clear immediate life threat).</p>
<p>&#8226; Subsequent &quot;Chief Complaint&quot; information regarding type/severity of medical emergency:</p>
<p>&#187; Chief complaint &#8211; If illness-related 911 call, additional screening questions include:</p>
<p>&#8211; Priority symptoms &#8211; severe bloody vomiting or diarrhea (e.g., large amounts of GI</p>
<p>blood loss), decreased level of consciousness, respiratory difficulty, chest pain</p>
<p>&#8211; Pertinent medical history - any known illness or exposures to Methicillin-resistant</p>
<p>Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), tuberculosis (TB), Clostridium difficile (C. difficile),</p>
<p>norovirus, etc.</p>
<p>&#8211; Pertinent travel history - any travel within the previous 21 days</p>
<p>&#8226; For the following specific chief complaints ask additional questions (below) and provide</p>
<p>emergency medical dispatch instructions as indicated:</p>
<p>&#187; Breathing problems</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#187; Cardiac/respiratory arrest</p>
<p>&#187; Chest pain &#187; Convulsions/seizure</p>
<p>&#187; Headache &#187; Hemorrhage</p>
<p>&#187; Sick person &#187; Unconscious/Fainting (or Near)</p>
<p>&#187; Unknown Problem (Person Down)</p>
<p>&#8226; Additional questions</p>
<p>&#187; Is there anyone else there who is also sick?</p>
<p>&#187; In the last day or two any:</p>
<p>&#8211; Fever or chills? &#8722; Vomiting or diarrhea?</p>
<p>&#8211; Severe cough? &#8722; Active bleeding?</p>
<p>For any positive questions, the emergency medical dispatcher will alert any first responders</p>
<p>and EMS providers being dispatched of potential for a patient with a communicable disease</p>
<p>and to implement infection control measures as indicated. This designation is preliminary</p>
<p>and responders may be able to adjust precautions based on further information from the</p>
<p>patient/family. If language barriers prevent questions, the dispatcher should advise the crew</p>
<p>that they cannot rule out an infectious patient.</p>
<p>Implement emerging infectious disease surveillance tool<sup>2</sup> whenever a novel or dangerous</p>
<p>disease is endemic in specific areas.</p>

<p><strong>FIRST RESPONDERS AND AMBULANCE RESPONDERS<sup>3</sup></strong></p>
<p>&#8226; Responders should have access to relevant information via radio or computer aided</p>
<p>dispatch (CAD) to assure alerting of potential risks.</p>
<p>&#8226; Ask dispatch/communications center for additional information if needed.</p>
<p>&#8226; Identify patients who may be infected with a serious communicable disease by verbal</p>
<p>screening and symptoms and recognize the potential hazards.</p>
<p>&#8226; First responders recognizing a potentially infectious patient should notify dispatch/</p>
<p>communications center to assure the en route ambulance responders are prepared to</p>
<p>implement appropriate infection prevention and control measures.</p>
<p>&#8226; Apply PPE appropriate for the patient's condition prior to making direct patient contact.</p>
<p>&#8226; Patients with respiratory illnesses: Interview conducted at least 6 feet away from the</p>
<p>patient may provide some protection from infectious droplets.</p>
<p>&#8226; Ask any patient with respiratory symptoms to wear a surgical mask if they can tolerate it.</p>
<p>&#8226; Limit the number of EMS providers making patient contact to the minimum required to</p>
<p>perform tasks safely. Consider the strategy of one provider putting on PPE and managing</p>
<p>the patient while the other provider does not engage in patient care, but provides the</p>
<p>&quot;doorway evaluation&quot; and communications/charting. The second provider should be</p>
<p>prepared to quickly don the appropriate PPE should the first provider require assistance.</p>
<p>&#8226; Avoid unnecessary direct contact with the patient.</p>
<p>&#8226; Use caution when approaching the disoriented or delirious patient, as erratic behavior (e.g.,</p>
<p>flailing or staggering) can place EMS providers at additional risk of exposure.</p>
<p>&#8226; Keep nonessential equipment away from the patient, so as to minimize contamination on</p>
<p>the scene and in the ambulance</p>
<p>&#8226; If patient has nausea or vomiting, treat symptoms per protocols, provide emesis bag, and</p>
<p>contain any emesis.</p>
<p>&#8226; For profuse diarrhea, consider asking the patient to wear an absorbing undergarment and/or</p>
<p>wrapping the patient in an impermeable sheet to reduce contamination of other surfaces.</p>
<p>&#8226; Choose a receiving facility appropriate to the potential disease and alert them about the</p>
<p>patient and estimated time of arrival (ETA) as early as possible.</p>
<p>&#8226; Contact medical control with questions or for additional guidance on symptoms/signs or</p>
<p>patient care.</p>
<p>For geographically-associated serious communicable diseases like EVD or MERS, the</p>
<p>public health or EMS medical authority may request responders ask additional screening</p>
<p>questions including:</p>
<p>1. Travel history and/or direct exposure to potential case within the number of days of the</p>
<p>incubation period for the illness of interest (e.g., Ebola &#8211; 21 days, MERS &#8211; 14 days)</p>
<p>2. Specific signs and symptoms of illness</p>
<p>Contact the EMS or public health authority for guidance about family members or close</p>
<p>patient contacts who may be at the scene.</p>
